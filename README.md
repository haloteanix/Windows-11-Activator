# Windows 11 Activator

[[ ** !!!DISCLAMER!!! ** ]]

This tool is NOT made by me at all. The code was found on the MS Guides website. I took the code and made it into an EXE file for people to use.

[[ ** !!!DISCLAMER 2!!! ** ]]

This has NOT been tested so try it out yourself please.

## How to use
It's quite simple. You will need to download the files in the Releases tab, then run Win11Activator.exe as Administrator. Just follow the steps on screen and you're good to go.

## Troubleshooting “connection to KMS server failed” error

1. Cause of Client

Make sure that Windows Update is enabled and your intenret connection is stable before running the batch files. To check if my KMS servers are blocked or not, please open your internet browser then try going to: http://kms8.msguides.com/. If the page is visible, it means this server is not blocked.

One other point to note is that you need to run command prompt/batch file with admin rights.

Otherwise, the connection will be denied by UAC system.

2. Cause of Server

Because the number of daily clients is too big and still increasing over time, so the server can also be stuck at times. You can check and see if the server is overloaded or not here: http://status.msguides.com.
